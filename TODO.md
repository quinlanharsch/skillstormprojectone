Project 1 (Due morning of 07/14/2023)
Inventory Management
Objective:
	Create an inventory management solution that will enable an administrator at a given company to manage the entities at any of its warehouses. The administrator should possess the ability to view, add, remove, and alter any of the entities within that companyâ€™s warehouse(s). The site should provide the administrative team with an easy portal to do their job so having clear and concise UI/UX is paramount. The application should also take into consideration possible edge cases such as warehouses having their own maximum capacity and handling the addition of items that would cause the warehouse to exceed its capacity.

Functional Requirements:
- Must be a full-stack solution consisting of:
    - Java with Spring Boot
    - PostgreSQL
    - A frontend consisting of either
        - HTML/CSS/JS
        - React
- Code should be available to a public GitHub repository
- Possesses all required CRUD functionality
- Handles edge cases effectively
- Non-Functional Requirements:
    - Well documented code 
    - Code upholds industry best practices (SOLID/DRY)
    - Industry-Grade UI (User Interface)
    - Intuitive UX (User Experience)
